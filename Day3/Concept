Introduction to Functions and Parameters
Welcome to Day 3 of our JavaScript Beginner Course! In today's lesson, we'll dive into the world of functions. Functions are essential building blocks in programming that allow you to group together a set of instructions and reuse them whenever needed. We'll also explore the concept of parameters, which enable you to make your functions more flexible and versatile. Let's get started!
Part 1: What are Functions?
A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to modularize your code, improve readability, and promote reusability. Instead of writing the same code over and over again, you can define a function and call it whenever you need to perform that task.



function functionName() {
    // Code to be executed
}

Here's an example of a simple function that displays a greeting message:



function greet() {
    console.log("Hello! Welcome to our website.");
}

// Call the function
greet();

Part 2: Function Parameters

Functions can also accept input values, known as parameters, which make them more flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.



function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
    // Code that uses the parameters
}

Here's an example of a function that takes two parameters and calculates their sum:



function addNumbers(a, b) {
    let sum = a + b;
    console.log("Sum:", sum);
}

// Call the function with arguments
addNumbers(5, 3); // Output: Sum: 8
```

Part 3: Return Statement

Functions can also return values using the `return` statement. This allows you to capture and use the result of a function in your program.



function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
    // Code that uses the parameters
    return result;
}

Here's an example of a function that calculates the area of a rectangle and returns the result:



function calculateArea(width, height) {
    let area = width * height;
    return area;
}

let rectangleArea = calculateArea(4, 6);
console.log("Rectangle Area:", rectangleArea); // Output: Rectangle Area: 24
